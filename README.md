#**CryptoByName**

This project automates the Crypto Payment. It works with natural language. 
It is the POC of the product that i am building. 

##**USAGE**

For using this You need to setup a mongo db where you have to store the public address of the recipient and his name or any thing that you call him.
You have to setup your private key in the project for signing the transactions. You also have to setup the network in which you will be working. 
In the project I am working with the Oasis Network. You can use any one just update the respective settings.

Now after setting up these things you can run the project and in the terminal you can type something like " transfer 3 eth to Shweta"
You must have setup the Shweta name with her address in the mongo db. 

This helps to transfering the crypto to someone without any hassle. It is same as once we save the contacts to dial we just have to remember the name not the number.
Rembering name is much more  like human and easy.

**NOTE**
It is just in developing so don't try with real crypto. You can use it with the test networks.
